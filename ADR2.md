# ADR 2: UI Framework
A user-friendly interface that's easy to navigate. Provides the user with a Seamless ordering process.

## Decision
We will use NativeBase for both Android and iOS Devices.

## Rationale
We chose to use NativeBase because we wanted to develop consistently and effectively for the two main mobile platforms. NativeBase provides a robust collection of components that feel natural to their respective platforms. This guarantees that customers, whether using an iPhone or an Android, receive a user interface that feels completely at home on their device. The versatility of NativeBase, which enables simple customisation and theming, speeds up the development process and assures consistency, also played a role in the selection.
## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- Consistent and modern UI
- Faster development cycles due to already available UI components.
- Improved maintainability
